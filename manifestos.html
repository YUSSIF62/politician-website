                                <p>Kileleshwa Ward is growing
                                    rapidly. Unfortunately water and sewer
                                    services are not keeping up! Despite the
                                    Nairobi rationing schedule many residents
                                    report either insufficient or no water on the
                                    appointed days.</p>
                                    <p>My campaign pledges to ensure that
                                        Kileleshwa is properly represented under
                                        the Master Plan for Developing New Water
                                        Sources for Nairobi City and Satellite
                                        Towns. In the short term, I will fight for the
                                        right amount of rationed water on our
                                        scheduled days. That’s a promise!</p>
                                    <p>Our sewer capacity requires proper
                                        planning & maintenance. Sewage along
                                        our roads and in our rivers is unhealthy &
                                        unsightly.</p>

                                <p>Kileleshwa roads are more than just
                                    car routes. Our community needs
                                    high quality roads, pedestrian and cycle
                                    lanes.</p>
                                    <p>Patching old roads is not enough. We
                                        deserves a long term plan for upgrading &
                                        maintaining roads to modern standards.
                                        This includes adequate drainage, signage
                                        and consistent street lighting.</p>
                                    <p>As our Community expands we want to
                                        walk, run and cycle more. Our roads MUST
                                        BE SAFE. We will work with residents,
                                        business owners and other stakeholders,
                                        including boda bodas to respect road rules.</p>
                                    <p>At a minimum, our Community expects the
                                        road standard achieved for the Kileleshwa
                                        Ring Road (also known as ‘Missing Link 6”
                                        or “bypass”). Where there is insufficient road
                                        reserve space the standard expected will be
                                        that achieved on Kikambala Road.</p>
                                        <p>I will prioritize decent public transport,
                                            including appropriate bus / matatu pick up &
                                            rest areas that are clean and safe.</p>

                                    of Kenya. The majority of residents are
                                    female. Additionally, youth (male and female
                                    under 35) are a rapidly growing
                                    demographic. Giving both these important
                                    groups extra attention is a recipe for future
                                    success. These individuals are our mothers,
                                    sisters, sons, daughters, nephews & nieces.
                                    Giving them a helping hand lifts the entire
                                    community.</p>

                                    with community engagement – we need to

                                    solutions. I will work with the National

                                    everybody deserves a clean and vibrant
                                    community.</p>
                                    <p>Kileleshwa is blessed with
                                        rivers along our boundaries,
                                        including Chiromo &
                                        Kirichwa Kubwa Rivers. We
                                        need to work together with
                                        government to keep our rivers free of sewage
                                        and other debris. Modern thinking around
                                        river management is needed to avoid
                                        needless evictions and demolitions based on
                                        short term measures.</p>
                                    <p>What happened to
                                        Kileleshwa community
                                        spaces? Where are children
                                        expected to play? We will
                                        collaborate with like-minded
                                        stakeholders to develop playgrounds and
                                        enhanced green spaces for community use.</p>
                                        <p>Our community must address
                                            solid waste management. This
                                            starts from our homes and
                                            streets. I will ensure there is
                                            funding to install litter bins along
                                            our streets and ensure garbage is regularly
                                            collected..</p>
