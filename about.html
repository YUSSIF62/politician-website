                                           <h3>Who is Cliff?</h3>
                                     </div>
                                     <p>Cliff is a proud Dad, Husband, Son, Brother & Neighbour who has lived in Kileleshwa Ward for over 10 years. Cliff was born in Nairobi and has lived in the current Dagoretti North Constituency for most of his life. He attended Riverside Farm Nursery School, The Makini School and Strathmore School all within Dagoretti North. </p>
                                     <p>He later studied Civil Engineering at the University of Nairobi for a year before proceeding to Australia where he completed a Bachelor of Science at Murdoch University & a Master of Commerce degree from the University of Western Australia – one of the Top 6 Australian universities. While at Murdoch University Cliff received the Vice Chancellor’s Award for Academic Excellence. He is a fully qualified member of CPA Australia.</p>
                                     <p>While in Australia, Cliff was one of the founders of the Kenya West Australian Students Association (KWASA) and was its inaugural Secretary-General.</p>
                                     <p>Cliff returned to Kenya after living and working in various overseas locations including stints in Zambia, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Finland, South Africa and Canada.</p>

                              <h3>Career</h3>
                        </div>
                        <p>Cliff was trained at KPMG in Australia, one of the world’s Big 4 Accounting firms.  He left KPMG as a Senior Advisor in its Risk Advisory Services division. He then joined global Canadian Copper, Gold & Nickel miner First Quantum Minerals (FQM) as an expatriate primarily based in Zambia as the Deputy Head, Corporate Governance, Risk Management & Internal Audit. Following a successful six year period with FQM Cliff decided to move back home to Kenya and settled in Kileleshwa Ward.</p>
                        <p>Cliff became an entrepreneur, establishing Standard & Mutual Limited (S&M) in Nairobi with a group of like-minded individuals. S&M was one of the pioneer Nominated Advisors on the Nairobi Securities Exchange’s GEMS board targeting listings by successful Small & Medium Enterprises. Successes at S&M included the successful listing of Kurwitu Ventures Limited in 2014. Cliff also acted as a mining subject matter expert for the National Assembly’s Committee on Environment & Natural Resources and the United Nations. He played a key role in the development and review of the Mining Act 2016. He is currently the Managing Director of S&M.</p>

                                           <h3>Politics</h3>
                                     </div>
                                     <p>I am running for the office of Member of County Assembly (MCA) – Kileleshwa Ward in Nairobi City County to represent our service delivery interests. Like many, I have invested a considerable amount to live in Kileleshwa. As someone raising a young family in the Ward, our collective standard of living is of paramount importance. The MCA role is responsible for legislation, representation, and oversight which are sorely lacking in Kileleshwa today. </p>
                                     <p>Our Ward deserves a representative who is 100% focused on service delivery. Cliff has the capacity to articulate the issues, legislate the solutions and oversee their implementation. We entrust our representatives to oversee an annual County budget of Ksh. 40 Billion. As an Accountant with business leadership and legislative experience, I am uniquely placed to interrogate and participate in our County’s budgetary and legislative process. As an entrepreneur, I understand the challenges of doing business in Nairobi and the need to focus on Value for Money solutions. Simply put, we must spend our hard earned taxes on providing services that improve our lives and livelihoods.</p>
                                     <p>Cliff’s key goal will be to address the state of our roads, lack of consistent water supply, dirty environment, diminishing green space, inadequate academic & health facilities, lack of income generation opportunities for women and youth and insecurity in our homes and on our streets.</p>
                                     <p>I am asking the people of Kileleshwa to join hands with me to make our Ward clean, safe and vibrant again. Tuungane Pamoja!</p>
